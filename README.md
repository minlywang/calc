calc
====

DSL a simple language implementation

calc is very small programing language deigned to be easy to understand for beginners, and any one can modify it without much effort, because I have created it just for a demonstration.

calc can do arithmetic operations (+, -, /, *,%) for integers, string concatenations and addition of string and interger. It has two conditions “IF” and "WHILE," importing Java packages, 
variables declaration, and executes ONLY public static methods such System.out.println.
